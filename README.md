# Non-Euclidean-Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a boring game.  There's not much to visualize or think about, and thus the skill ceiling is very low.  Even a par Tic-Tac-Toe player should be able to never lose a single match.  But what if there were a way to add some spice to Tic-Tace-Toe.  What if you played it on a torus (aka Tic-Tac-Torus), hyperbola, or some other nightmare?  What if you could also spontaneously change the size of the board between every match?  This project attempts to answer those questions.

This project was created in a day, after learning about Tic-Tac-Torus in my Number Theory class.  I had attempted to play a friend on a six-by-six grid on paper, only to later discover that we could not confidently decide if someone won.  This program solves that issue, by dynamically finding all solutions for an n-by-n grid, and checking them for you.  But because this project was made under such a short time span, many short cuts were taken and there is much room for improvement.  Feel free to suggest any improvements/new ideas/new topographies!

## Current Features:
- Play Tic-Tac-Toe on a Torus
- Spontaneously change the board size to anything-- although realistically, anything after a ten-by-ten will start getting too small to play on.
- Turn indicator

## Possible Improvements
- More topographies-- spheres, hyperbola, klein bottle, etc.
- Some sort of timer
- Win counter/Ability to restart game
